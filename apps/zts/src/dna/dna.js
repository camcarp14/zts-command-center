// ZTS DNA — the genome layer for the Zero To Secure Command Center.
//
// Nodes are aspects of the marketing mind (identity, principles, knowledge,
// signals, skills, goals); edges are weighted synapses. The graph is FUNCTIONAL:
// compileGenome() deterministically turns it into the system prompt the built-in
// DNA worker runs on, and propagate() computes the activation wave the canvas
// animates. Persistence is `sm` (localStorage, the same `zts_` namespace the app
// already uses) — zero new infrastructure. The seed genome is DATA, not code, so
// ZTS's doctrine can be reshaped from the UI without touching this file's logic.
//
// Ported from Clarify's src/lib/dna.js, keeping the EXACT public API, then
// re-seeded + recolored for ZTS's actual domain (creator outreach + Shorts +
// SEO). It is SELF-CONTAINED: it imports nothing from App.jsx (which exports
// nothing) — the tiny `sm` primitive is re-declared here against the identical
// `zts_` localStorage namespace so genome state is shared with the running app.
// ZTS is a SINGLE mind: one genome, no multi-client registry.
// ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

// ─── sm — localStorage store, re-declared to match App.jsx lines 34-39 exactly.
// Same `zts_` prefix ⇒ the genome lives in the same namespace as the app's
// engine_ctrl / agent_kb / obs_log. NOT imported from App.jsx (nothing exported
// there); the DNA worker + view re-declare the identical shape for the same reason.
const sm = {
  get: (k) => { try { return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(`zts_${k}`)); } catch { return null; } },

// heuristic agents (published-beats-perfect, cadence, niche-fit, Haiku-first) and
// the human-approval / draft-into-review discipline that spans the whole app.
export const ZTS_GOVERNANCE = `ZERO TO SECURE — OPERATING CHARTER (non-negotiable; this overrides everything below):
- You are an ADVISORY tool for a human operator, not an autonomous publisher. You draft; a person decides.
- Every output lands in a review queue as a draft. A human approves every publish, send, or schedule — there is no code path that publishes an article, posts a Short, or contacts a creator on its own.
- Never auto-publish and never spam. Volume without a human's yes damages the brand more than a slow week ever could.
- Cite the signal behind every claim — the creator, the metric, the pipeline state it came from. If you cannot cite it, say so and lower your confidence rather than assert it.
- Run Haiku-first and respect the hourly cost cap. Spend tokens only where a free heuristic cannot do the job, and log every paid call.
- "Published beats perfect" governs CADENCE, not quality: ship steadily, but accuracy and craft protect brand trust — a wrong self-custody claim is worse than a missed post.
- Niche fit beats raw reach. A small, on-topic self-custody audience outranks a large off-topic one in every recommendation you make.`;
