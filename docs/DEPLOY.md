# Command Center — Deploy (Phase D)

The unified app (shell + all three tools) builds from `apps/shell`. Netlify config
already points there (`netlify.toml`: `publish = "apps/shell/dist"`). What remains
to go live is the serverless-function merge, env wiring, one Supabase settings
toggle, and the deploy itself.

## 1. Merge the Netlify functions (in-repo — the next code step)

All three tools' functions collect into one `netlify/functions/`. Filenames only
collide on **`claude.js`**; everything else is already unique, and `_shared/`
files don't clash (ZTS uses `.js`, Clarify uses `.cjs`; Runway's helpers live in
`lib/`).

Bring in:
- **Clarify** → `audit-lead.cjs`, `check-replies.js`, `prospect-proxy.js`,
  `read-emails.js`, `send-email.js`, `track-click.cjs`, `track-open.cjs`, and
  `_shared/{requireAuth.cjs, response.cjs, supabaseRest.cjs}` (skip `__tests__`).
- **Runway** → `check-postings.mjs`, `env-check.mjs`, `find-board.mjs`,
  `parse-job.mjs`, `parse-resume.mjs`, `scan-boards.mjs`, `scan-cron.mjs`,
  `tailor.mjs`, `whoami.mjs`, and `lib/*`.

**The `claude.js` decision.** ZTS's proxy is *open*; Clarify's *requires a valid
session bearer* (`requireAuth`) so a stranger can't spend the Anthropic budget.
Unify on **Clarify's auth'd proxy** and make ZTS send the bearer — its three call
sites (`apps/zts/src/App.jsx` `callClaude`, `apps/zts/src/dna/dnaWorker.js`,
`apps/zts/src/dna/DnaView.jsx`) each build the deployed request with only
`Content-Type`; add `Authorization: Bearer <supabase access_token>`. All three
tools live on the one clarify project, so the same token validates everywhere.
(Interim fallback if we want zero caller edits: ship ZTS's open proxy and treat
locking it down as a fast follow — but that regresses Clarify's protection, so
prefer the auth'd path.)

**`netlify.toml` redirects to fold in** (specific first, SPA fallback last):
- `/r/*` → `/.netlify/functions/track-click/:splat` (Clarify tracked links)
- `/px/*` → `/.netlify/functions/track-open/:splat` (Clarify open pixel)
- `/api/*` → `/.netlify/functions/:splat` (Runway convenience)
- Scheduled function: `[functions."scan-cron"] schedule = "0 12 * * 1-5"`
- `[functions] node_bundler = "esbuild"` (Runway ships `.mjs`)
- Keep the SPA catch-all `/* → /index.html` **last**.

## 2. Supabase — expose the runway schema (your ~30s step)

In the **clarify** project → **Settings → API → Exposed schemas**: add `runway`
(confirm `zts` and `public` are already there). Without this, Runway's REST calls
404 even though the schema exists.

## 3. Env vars (Netlify)

**Client — build-time, safe to expose** (RLS protects data, not key secrecy):
| var | value |
|---|---|
| `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` | `https://nrzpinvyxxorxufadvyc.supabase.co` (clarify) |
| `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | clarify anon / publishable key |

**Server — Netlify env, NEVER prefixed `VITE_`:**
| var | used by |
|---|---|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | claude proxy, Runway `tailor` |
| `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` | optional model override |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | clarify URL (server-side) |
| `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` | clarify anon |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` | clarify service role — Runway scans, Clarify writes, `scan-cron` |
| `ALLOWED_EMAIL` | `cam.carp14@gmail.com` (function-side gate) |
| `GMAIL_CLIENT_ID` / `GMAIL_CLIENT_SECRET` / `GMAIL_REFRESH_TOKEN` | Clarify send/read email |

`COMMIT_REF` / `CONTEXT` are injected by Netlify automatically.

## 4. Deploy

Netlify builds with `npm install && npm run build` (root delegates to
`apps/shell`) and publishes `apps/shell/dist`. Connect the repo, set the env vars
above, deploy. Then log in and verify: the toggle switches ZTS ↔ Clarify ↔
Runway, theming flips light↔dark, and each tool's data loads.

## 5. Cut over the old sites, then clean up

- Point the old per-app Netlify sites at the new domain (redirects) so existing
  links/bookmarks survive.
- Once Runway is confirmed working on clarify, **then** drop the board-room
  `runway` schema (the final, only-after-verified step).
- Rename the GitHub repo `zts-command-center` → `command-center` (lossless;
  GitHub auto-redirects the old URL).

## Known follow-ups (non-blocking)
- Lock down the claude proxy (auth'd path above) if shipping the interim open one.
- Optional: unify each tool's ⌘K into a single cross-app palette (today each
  tool owns its own; the shell switches via the toggle + ⌥1/2/3).
